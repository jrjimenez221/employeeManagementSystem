# Issues
### View Employee by Manager : Line 155
    * Display Employee Names to select from
    * Once chosen return employees who have a matching reports_to to the
      selected employee's id.
### View Department Budget : Line 196
    * Display Departments to choose from
    * Make a Sum of the salaries of all employees working there 
### Change Employee Role : Line 265
    * Display employees + role to choose from
    * Display role to change employee's role into

## Notes
* Removed extra code for readability
* All three issues relate to how I'm attempting to make 2 connection queries
* After writing this README I think I'll try to write some external
   functions to hold the second connection query
* I would really appreciate this
